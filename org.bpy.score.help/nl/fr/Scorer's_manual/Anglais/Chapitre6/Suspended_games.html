			<span style="">Suspended games</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The rule 7.02(a) of the OBR gives some of the possible reasons why a game may be suspended: </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A game shall become a suspended game that must be completed at a future date if the game is terminated for any of the following reasons: </span>
		</p>
		<ul style="1">
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A curfew imposed by law; </span>
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A time limit permissible under league rules;</span>
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Light failure or malfunction of a mechanical field device under control of the home club. (Mechanical field device shall include automatic tarpaulin or water removal equipment.); </span>
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Darkness, when a law prevents the lights from being turned on; </span>
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Weather, if a regulation game is called while an inning is in progress and before the inning is completed, and the visiting team has scored one or more runs to take the lead, and the home team has not retaken the lead, or </span>
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is a regulation game that is called with the score tied </span>
		</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The game is considered a regulation game in cases 1) and 2) and, if called due to weather where the following conditions given in rule 7.01(c) of the OBR obtain:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">If a game is called, it is a regulation game: </span>
		</p>
		<ul style="1">
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">If five innings have been completed; </span>
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">If the home team has scored more runs in four or four and a fraction half-innings than the visiting team has scored in five completed </span>
			<span style="">halfinnings</span>
			<span style="">; </span>
		</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">If the home team scores one or more runs in its half of the fifth inning to tie the score.</span>
		</p>
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style=""> If a game is suspended in the circumstances described in rule 7.02 points 3 and 4, rule 7.02(c) states that the game shall be resumed at the exact point of suspension of the original game.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">The completion of a suspended game is a continuation of the original game. The players in the dugouts and the lineups of both teams must be exactly the same as those in effect at the time the game was suspended, and they are subject to the rules governing substitutions. Any player may be replaced by a player who had not taken part in the game before it was suspended. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">No player who was replaced before the suspension of the game may return to take part in the game. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">Moreover, the note to Rule 7.02(a) states: Weather and similar conditions – Rules 7.02(a</span>
			<span style="">)(</span>
			<span style="">1) through 7.02(a)(5) - shall take precedence in determining whether a called game shall be a suspended game. If a game is halted by weather, and subsequent light failure or an intervening curfew or time limit prevents its resumption, the game shall not be a suspended game. If a game is halted by light failure, and weather or field conditions prevent its resumption, the game shall not be a suspended game. A game can only be considered a suspended game if stopped for any of the six reasons specified in Rule 7.02(a). </span>

			<span style="">Example 1</span>
			<span style="">: The game is called during the second half of the eighth inning, with the score as given below. According to the provisions of the WBSC Baseball Division tournament rules, the game is considered complete and the final score is that which obtained at the end of the seventh inning. The final result is thus 5 to 3 for the home team.</span>
