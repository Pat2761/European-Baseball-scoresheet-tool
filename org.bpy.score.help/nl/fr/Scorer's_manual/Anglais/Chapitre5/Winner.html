		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Comment</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">: It is the intent of Rule 9.17(b) that a relief pitcher pitch at least one complete inning or pitch when a crucial out is made, within</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">the context of the game (including the score) in order to be credited as</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">the winning pitcher. If the first relief pitcher pitches effectively, the official score should not presumptively credit that pitcher with the win,</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">because the rule requires that the </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">win be credited to the pitcher who</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">was the most effective, and a subsequent relief pitcher may have been</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">most effective. The official scorer, in determining which relief pitcher was the most effective, should consider the number of runs, earned runs and base runners given up by each relief pitcher and the context</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">of the game at the time of each relief pitcher’s appearance. If two or more relief pitchers were similarly effective, the official scorer should</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">give the presumption to the earlier pitcher as the winning pitcher.</span>

			<span style="">The official scorer shall not credit as the winning pitcher a relief pitcher who is ineffective in a brief appearance, when at least one succeeding relief pitcher pitches effectively in helping his team maintain its lead.
