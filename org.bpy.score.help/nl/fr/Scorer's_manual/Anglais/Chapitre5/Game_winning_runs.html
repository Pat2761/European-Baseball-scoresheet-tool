			<span style="">Game winning runs</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A game-winning run is a run that puts one team in the lead. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Before looking at some examples, it is worth noting that at the exact</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">moment when one team draws level, it is as if a new game had started for</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">the purposes of determining the game-winning run.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The game-winning run is also the run that identifies the losing pitcher</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">of a game.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Example 48</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">: Game won by the home team by 5 to 4. It can be seen from the box score that the home team retained the advantage from the first inning.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style=""><img src="./images/Game_winning_runs_0.jpg" height="74" width="377" ></span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The game-winning run is therefore the first run scored in the first inning. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Example 49</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">: Game won 6-5 by the visiting team. An analysis of the scoring reveals that the fifth inning ended with both teams level (3 all). In the first half of the next inning, the visitors scored the first run and drew ahead (4</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">to 3), increasing their lead with two more </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">  r</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">uns (6 to 3), while their</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">opponents only managed to close the gap by scoring the final two runs of</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">the inning.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><img src="./images/Game_winning_runs_1.jpg" height="75" width="377" ></span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The game-winning run therefore is the first of the three runs scored by the visiting team in the sixth inning.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Example 50</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">: Game won by the visiting team 9 to 8. The visitors ended their first turn at  at with nine runs. Despite scoring one run in each of the succeeding innings, the home team  as unable to catch up and lost the</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">match.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style=""><img src="./images/Game_winning_runs_2.jpg" height="75" width="377" ></span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Th</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">e game-winning run is the one that put the visiting team in the </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">lead</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">,which</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> in this case was the first run of the game.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Example 51</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">: Game won 10-9 by the home team. At the end of the first half of the sixth inning the score stood at 8 to 6 for the visitors. The crucial turning point came in the second half of the same inning, when the home</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">team scored four </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">r</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">uns, putting them in the lead (10 to 8), a lead they kept</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">until the end of the match.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style=""><img src="./images/Game_winning_runs_3.jpg" height="75" width="377" ></span>
		</p>
		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The game-winning run is one of the four scored in the sixth inning by the winning team. So, with the first run the home team began to close in (7 to 8); with the second they drew level (8 all); with the third they pulled ahead</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(9 to 8) and with the last one they put even more distance between them</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(10 to 8). The game-winning run was therefore the third of these. </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Example 52</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">: Game won by the home team, 11 to 9. At the end of the seventh inning the score stood at 4 to 6 for the home team. The visitors, however, scored three runs in the next inning and pulled into the lead (7 to</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">6). If the game had ended with this result the game-winning run would be the last of these three, i.e. the seventh run. However, the team second to bat ended the inning having scored another five runs (7 to 11), making it</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">impossible for their opponents to catch up. Looking at the progress of the score in the eighth inning, it becomes clear that the home team equalized</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">with the first of the five runs (7 all); the second put them in the lead (8 to</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">7); and the next three widened the gap. Their opponents succeeded in scoring only two runs, putting the final score at 9 to 11 against them.</span>

		<p class="Exemple">
			<span style=""><img src="./images/Game_winning_runs_4.jpg" height="74" width="377" ></span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The game-winning run is therefore the second run scored by the home team in the eighth inning.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Example 53</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">: Game won by the visiting team by 12 to 11. If we look at the interim scores at the end of each inning, it becomes clear how a game</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">winning run can vary </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">d</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">epending on the runs scored by the teams and the</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">ups and downs of the score line.</span>

			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">ahead</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> (2-1). </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They then increase their lead with a second run (3- 1). </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Their opponents score another run (3-2). </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The game-winning run is therefore the run that put the visitors 2-1 ahead.</span>
