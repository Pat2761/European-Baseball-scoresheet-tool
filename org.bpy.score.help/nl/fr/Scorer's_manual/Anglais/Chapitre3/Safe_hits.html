			<span style="">by letters identifying the zone in the field.</span>

		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">In the descriptions of safe hits we have introduced a fundamental</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">concept: Ordinary effort by a fielder. </span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-BoldItalic;"><b>Ordinary effort is the effort that a</b></span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-BoldItalic;"><b> </b></span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-BoldItalic;"><b>fielder of average skill at a position in that league or classification of</b></span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-BoldItalic;"><b> </b></span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-BoldItalic;"><b>leagues should exhibit on a play, with due consideration given to the</b></span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-BoldItalic;"><b> </b></span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-BoldItalic;"><b>condition of the field and weather conditions. </b></span>
			<span style="">[OBR Definition of Terms –Ordinary Effort] </span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Italic;">This standard, called for several times in the Official</span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Italic;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Italic;">Scoring Rules (e.g. Rules 9.05(a)(3), 9.05(a)(4), 9.05(a)(6), 9.05(b)(3)(Base</span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Italic;"> </span>

			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Italic;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Italic;">Rules (e.g. Definition of Terms - Infield Fly)), is an objective standard in</span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Italic;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Italic;">regard to any particular fielder.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">In other words, even if a fielder makes his best effort, if that effort falls</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">short of what an average fielder at that position in that league would have</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">made in a situation, the official scorer should charge that fielder with an</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">error</span>
			<span style="">[</span>
			<span style="">OBR Definition of Terms Comment]. We should say straight away</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">that this is a very flexible concept that can vary from one scorer to</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">another. We will therefore try to give guidelines based on the rules</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">themselves and on experience.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">A first recommendation is not to demand absolute perfection from the</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">defense: in the case of a particularly difficult performance, award a hit</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">rather than an error. The scorer will simply record the actions as occurred</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">leaving it to the manager to judge the players for having reacted too late or</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">having moved too slowly. It is also necessary to bear in mind that balls are</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">often hit with great force, making them extremely difficult to handle.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">One very important factor that can influence the scoring of hits is the</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">defensive positions that the players assume before the hit. This determines</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">the difficulty of the play. Clearly, a hit will be more difficult to catch if the</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">players are closer, given the higher velocity of the ball. Before any action</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">takes place, therefore, be aware of the positions of the fielders.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">No error should be charged to a fielder who loses time feinting or</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">turning to another base, even if, in the scorer’s judgment, a putout on first</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">base would have been more possible and safer. Moreover, no article of the</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">OBR provides for an error being charged against an outfielder if the ball</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">bounces in front of him and over his head.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">This is easy to understand, as he was unable to touch the ball in the</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">first instance, not being close enough, and he could not catch it after it had</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">bounced.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">Moreover, there are some positions for which it is advisable to think</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">twice before charging an error. Let us look at them:</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold;"><b>The pitcher </b></span>
			<span style="">- When the hit is made, the pitcher is still completing his</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">recovery movement after having delivered the ball, and is leaning forward,</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">which means that a hit going over him would be very difficult to control,</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">particularly if it had been hit hard. It therefore becomes difficult to make a</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">play and the hit is therefore automatically considered a valid hit.</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">Obviously, this is not the case if the hit is so slow as to enable the pitcher</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">to return to a normal position in time to catch it. For the above reasons,</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">the pitcher is also the only player exonerated from error if a fast ball</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">passes between his legs.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold;"><b>The catcher </b></span>
			<span style="">- The catcher’s position is unlike that of the other fielders and</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">this gives him a disadvantage in certain situations. A throw made to</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">prevent a stolen base is not considered an error, provided that the runner</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">does not subsequently advance. There may also be situations in which it is</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">unclear whether to award a wild pitch or a passed ball; if in doubt, we</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">suggest you give a wild pitch, bearing in mind how uncomfortable it is for</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">the catcher to make certain movements.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold;"><b>The shortstop </b></span>
			<span style="">- He is the infielder with the greatest area to cover. This</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">means he is obliged to deal with frequent difficult catches which, for that</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">very reason, cannot be considered errors. For example, a sideways lunge</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">for the ball, a catch at the edge of the red dirt, in front of third base or with</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">his back to the diamond, must all be considered difficult.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold;"><b>The second baseman </b></span>
			<span style="">- In the event of a ground ball hit towards second</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">base, which may be caught with ordinary effort, and which the fielder fails</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">to catch, an error shall be charged in the absence of any obvious and</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">relevant sideways motion by the fielder.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold;"><b>The third baseman </b></span>
			<span style="">- The zone in which the third baseman operates is</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">where the majority of balls hit within the diamond end up, and where they</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">are the fastest. Many of these balls are therefore difficult to control, given</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">their speed, particularly if they bounce before entering the third base</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">zone. Indeed, if they bounce, the balls may take an unnatural trajectory,</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">increasing the difficulty of the catch. It is important to pay close attention</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">to the speed of the ball in order to judge the difficulty of the catch.</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold;"><b>NOTE: </b></span>
			<span style="">Similar considerations apply to the first baseman when the batter is</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">left-handed.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Calibri-Bold;"><b>Outfielders </b></span>
			<span style="">- If a ball hit to the outfielders bounces in front of a fielder who</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">has come forward to catch it on the fly and passes over his head, credit the</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">batter with a two-base hit (or more), rather than a single, and an extra</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">base error.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">Another important concept that should be borne in mind in assessing</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">the value of hits is </span>
			<span style="">that the official scorer shall</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">always</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">give the batter</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style=""><b>the benefit of the doubt</b></span>
			<span style="">. A safe course for the official scorer to follow is to score a hit when</span>
