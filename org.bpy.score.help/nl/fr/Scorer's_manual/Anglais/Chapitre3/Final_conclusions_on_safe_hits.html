			<span style="">Final conclusions on safe hits</span>
		</p>
		<p class="GameEditorCopy">

		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To conclude this section on safe hits, we feel it is appropriate to add</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">some considerations on safe hits and errors, and on the criteria to be used</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">when judging such issues.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Baseball is all about hits, which is why the scorer, before giving an</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">error, should think carefully and if there is any doubt, score a hit.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The rules confirm that a difficult catch should never be considered an</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">error, and that the scorer’s judgment should determine which are easy</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">catches and which are difficult. As we have already seen, some positionsinvolve more difficult catches than easy ones, which is why a little more</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">caution is needed.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In general, therefore, an error should be charged if, and only if, the scorer is convinced the fielder could have made a putout (also after an extremely difficult play)</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A problem that sometimes arises for scorers is how to act when two</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">fielders both try to catch the same fly ball and consequently miss it. The</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">general rule in such cases is to decide which of the fielders would have</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">been able to catch the ball, and charge an error to the fielder who spoiled</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">his chances. In any case it must be borne in mind that, while infielders</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">cannot be let off errors with ordinary fly balls, if two outfielders find</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">themselves in this situation and neither one touched the ball or had an</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">opportunity to play it, no error is charged as it is usually very difficult to</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">establish whose ball it was.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">For this reason, there being significant doubt, the hit is scored as safe.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It should also be remembered that if two fielders both go for a fly ball in</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">foul territory, it is best not to charge any error.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In terms of errors of judgment which, according to the rules, are not</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">counted as errors, and consequently score as a safe hit for the batter, we</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">should point out that there is an exception. If a fielder is dazzled by the sun</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">or artificial lights, but still playing at his utmost best to try to make the out,</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">we record a hit to the batter. Only when no effort is made to avoid the sun</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">or the artificial lights and the fielder muffs the play, we record an error.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If a fielder recovers the ball in time to make a putout but throws to</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">another base, from where no play is possible, an error should always be</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">given.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It should also be remembered that the scorer must always interpret the</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">umpire’s rulings and may not take any decision that contradicts these.</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Thus, when an umpire calls "safe" and "ball on the ground" on a runner,</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">because a fielder in contact with the base drops the ball, an error must</span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
			<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">always be charged, even if it was a difficult call.</span>
