			<span style=""><b>Blown Save</b></span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">A blown save is charged to a pitcher who enters a game in a situation</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">which permits him to earn a save, but who instead allows the tying run to</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">score. Note that if the tying run was scored by a runner who was already</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">on base when the new pitcher entered the game, that new pitcher will be</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">charged with a blown save even though the run will not be charged to the</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">new pitcher, but rather to the pitcher who allowed that runner to reach</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">base.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">If that same pitcher also allows the go-ahead run to reach base and</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">score, and if his team does not come back to tie or gain a lead in the game,</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">said pitcher will be charged with both the loss and a blown save</span>
			<span style="">.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">The blown save is not an officially recognized statistic, but many</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">sources keep track of them.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">Once a pitcher blows a save, he is no longer eligible to earn a save in</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">that game (since the lead that he was trying to "save" has disappeared),</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">although he can earn a win if his team regains the lead. For this reason,</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">most closers' records include a few wins.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">Closers make the majority of their appearances with their team ahead,</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">so a loss usually includes a blown save.</span>

			<span style="font-family: Cambria,Bold;"><b>Hold</b></span>
		</p>
		<p class="GameEditorCopy">
			<br>		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">A hold is credited to a relief pitcher who:</span>

		<ul style="1">
		<li>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">enters the game in a save situation</span>
		</p>

		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">relinquished</span>
			<span style=""> the lead at any point and does not record a save.</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">Note that since the hold is not an official Major League Baseball</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">statistic, the definition can vary. One noticeable difference is that while</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">STATS, Inc. requires the pitcher to record at least one out for a hold,</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">Sports</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">Ticker does not have this requirement. This can result </span>
			<span style="">indiscrepancies</span>

			<span style="">In baseball a starting pitcher (also referred to as the starter) is the</span>

		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">A relief pitcher or reliever is a pitcher who enters the game after the</span>

			<span style="">or for other strategic reasons, such as being substituted by a pinch hitter.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">Relief pitchers are further divided informally into closers, set-up relief</span>

			<span style="">Middle relief pitchers (or "middle relievers") are relief pitchers who</span>

			<span style="">weak right-handed batters, and switch-hitters who bat poorly right</span>

			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">Because baseball practices permanent substitution, these pitchers</span>
			<span style=""> </span>

			<span style="">The pitcher generally has an advantage when his handedness is </span>

		</p>
		<p class="Texte">
			<span style="">This is because a right-handed </span>

			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">handed</span>
			<span style=""> </span>

			<span style=""> </span>

			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">Furthermore, since most pitchers are right-handed, left-handed batters</span>

			<span style="">a game in which a team was not able to record a single hit. Major League</span>
			<span style=""> </span>
			<span style="">Baseball officially defines a no-hitter as a completed game in which a team</span>
